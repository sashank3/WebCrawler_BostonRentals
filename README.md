# Boston Realty: Comprehensive Analytics and Dashboards

Summary:

This project aims to reform the housing search experience in Boston through a comprehensive data-driven approach that includes web crawling, real-time dashboarding, and automated deployment. We used a Python along with several libraries for web scraping and data wrangling. We then used an SQLite database to connect to Tableau for a seamless, real-time dashboard. Finally, we deployed a modified version of the Python code with PySpark on an Azure Databricks server and connected to dynamically in real-time to Tableau Cloud.

This enables our end users to coherently access our comprehensive dashboard, empowering users to explore available options, assess rental trends, and ultimately find homes that best suit their needs and preferences.
